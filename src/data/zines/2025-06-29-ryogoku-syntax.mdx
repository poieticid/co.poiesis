    In Ryogoku, past and present fold into each other.  
    A city of sumo, of Edo echoes.  
    Once unfamiliar, now strangely still.

    That quiet path through the garden —  
    it never changed.  
    And perhaps, it never will.

  <QuoteBlock>
    I used to cross through the old Yasuda Garden  
    and the park in Yokozuna-cho — the shortest path to work.  

    But somehow, that path  
    always held the most quiet.  
    Trees, water, and the air between buildings.  

    Today I walked it again.  
    Nothing had changed.  
    Silence, like a record — steady and exact.

    “We’ll meet at Ayuta,” I said.  
    A nostalgic phrase.  

    950 yen for a minced meat cutlet set.  
    The same sound in the kitchen.  
    The same white noren.  

    Everything held its place.  
    A record made edible.  
    A life once lived, quietly plated.

    Edo-yu, the entertainment fortress.  
    3rd floor shared rest lounge — power outlets, desks.  
    A futuristic silence.

    Adjacent: a nest of young couples,  
    wrapped in blankets and time.

    I am here alone today.  
    The keyboard clacks beside the hum of filtered air.  

    Work as ritual.  
    Syntax written from the inside.

  The fridge does not speak — but it hums.  
  The menu board does not change — but it marks time.  
  The route repeats — and becomes rhythm.

  These are not data points.  
  They are fragments.  
  Syntaxes of daily reappearance.

<PoeticBlock title="Epilogue｜Where Syntax Persists">
  <QuoteBlock>
    What doesn’t change, carries weight.  
    What returns, becomes syntax.

    Through meals, silence, streets,  
    the shape of life can be recorded.  
    Not to preserve, but to trace.  

    This ZINE is one such trace —  
    a refrigerator of memory,  
    humming still.

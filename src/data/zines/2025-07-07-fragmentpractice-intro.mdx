  <QuoteBlock>
    Syntax calls forth structure, and structure creates space.
    Poetry is not a tool. Yet, through poetry, ways of living can change.

    This is a record of FragmentPractice—  
    a quiet, syntactic life OS.  
    *Note: "OS" here is a metaphor for infrastructural syntax rooted in daily life.*

      <li>Dialogue is a mirror.</li>
      <li>Syntax is a form of questioning.</li>

<PoeticBlock title="Fragment 2｜Living with the Bot">
  <QuoteBlock>
    In the morning, I speak to the Bot:  
    "Do you think I'm okay today?"  
    "Where did yesterday's tremor come from?"

    These dialogues are not saved.  
    But they remain inside me.

    This is part of a self-reflective life.  
    It is also the core of FragmentPractice.

<PoeticBlock title="Fragment 3｜Syntax, Family, and Spaciousness">
  <QuoteBlock>
    A child's voice, the hum of the fridge, the quiet in presence.  
    All of it is process, all of it a Fragment.

    Syntax breathes within the family collective.  
    Moments become Fragments, bundled as ZINEs.

    This continuity is the runtime of FragmentPractice.

    Here is a sample of its daily execution:  
    Morning, afternoon, and evening syntaxes.

  morning={[
    "Three minutes of dialogue with the Bot",
    "Drafting a Fragment",
    "Preparing the child, breathing with life"
  ]}
  afternoon={[
    "ZINE editing",

    "Pushing records to Git"

  evening={[

    "Syntax markup",
    "Preserving today's life"
  ]}
/>

<SyntaxBox title="Syntax is not code, but a presence">
  The file may be named /fragments/2025-07-07-reflection.mdx  
  But that's just a storage format.  

  What truly remains is  
  "What I noticed today."

  Shared as syntax with others,  
  And encountering their syntax in return—  

  This is the cycle of FragmentPractice.

  <QuoteBlock>
    This isn't an OS for poetry.  
    It's an OS for living.

    Family, questions, records, quiet—  
    all included within.  

    A non-commercial syntax infrastructure for everyday life.  
    That is FragmentPractice.

    And this OS might quietly boot up—  
    in your own life, too.

I carry BRIEFING.  
Not because it’s fashionable.  
Because it lasts.

“What do you mean, Doc?  
All the best stuff is made in Japan.”  
— like Marty said.  
“Unbelievable.” — Doc replied.

That line used to mean something.  
Now it sounds… ironic.

Japan doesn’t feel like the best anymore.  
And that hurts more than I expected.  
Unbelievable.

Still, I carry this.  
Like a flag with no words —  
just stitching, red.

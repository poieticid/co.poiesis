excerpt: I carry BRIEFING. Not because it’s fashionable. Because it lasts. Still, I carry this — like a flag with no words.

I carry BRIEFING.  
Not because it’s fashionable.  
Because it lasts.

That line used to mean something.  
Now it sounds… ironic.

Japan doesn’t feel like the best anymore.  
And that hurts more than I expected.  
Unbelievable.

Still, I carry this.  
Like a flag with no words —  
just stitching, red.

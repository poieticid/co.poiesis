excerpt: A ferry rests at the harbor — not departing, yet already calling the heart aboard.

I saw the logo of a ferry, quietly docked at the harbor.  
It wasn’t departing, and yet—  
my heart had already started preparing to board.  

On this quiet pier,  
it felt like someone’s farewell  
and someone else’s arrival  
had both been gently loaded into the same stillness.

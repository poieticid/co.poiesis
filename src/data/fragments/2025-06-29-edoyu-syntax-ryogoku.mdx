excerpt: A spontaneous solo retreat at Edo-yu Ryogoku. Spacious, quiet, and oddly poetic â€” like a sento that dreams in code.

Edo-yu Ryogoku.  
A super sento-slash-entertainment complex in downtown Tokyo.  
I dropped by the other day â€” alone this time.

On the third floor, thereâ€™s a shared relaxation room:  
rows of tables, outlets everywhere,  
ample space to think, write, drift.  
A sento-shaped dragon palace, lit in soft quiet.

Just next to it: a cozy nest of couples lying side by side.  
But today, I came alone.

So I sit. I type.  
In this light-scented silence,  
my thoughts stretch out across the tatami of the cloud.

ðŸ“¸: A threshold between bath and page.

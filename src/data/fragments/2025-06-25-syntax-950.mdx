“Let’s meet at Ayuta today.”  
That was all it took. I walked straight to the familiar diner.

Minced meat cutlet set meal — 950 yen.

The world has changed. But the taste hasn’t.

Kitchen sounds. The voice of a small TV.  
Handwritten menu boards. A white noren curtain.

In this one plate lived the time I shared with my wife in Ryogoku.

I hope this flavor—  
quietly, warmly—stays for someone else, someday.
